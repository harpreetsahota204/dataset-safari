    "# AIMv2 vs CLIP Robustness on ImageNet-D\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/assets/imagenet-d.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageNet-D is a new benchmark of synthetically generated images (via Stable Diffusion) that's pushing image classification models to their breaking points with challenging images and revealing critical failures in model robustness. \n",
    "\n",
    "A high-level overview of ImageNet-D:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's composed of 4,835 \"hard images.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "* ImageNet-D spans 113 overlapping categories between ImageNet and ObjectNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset incorporates 547 nuisance variations, including a wide array of backgrounds (3,764), textures (498), and materials (573), making it far more diverse than previous benchmarks. By systematically varying these factors, ImageNet-D comprehensively assesses how well a model can truly \"see\" beyond superficial image features.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of ImageNet-D is the concept of \"hard images\". To create a challenging test, the researchers employed a clever strategy to mine hard samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They generated a large pool of images using diffusion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They then used a set of \"surrogate models\" (pre-trained vision models) to identify images that were commonly misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only these challenging \"hard images\" were retained for the final ImageNet-D dataset. This ensures that the benchmark focuses on the weaknesses of current models and provides a more informative evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote an in-depth blog about the ImageNet-D dataset, which you can read [here](https://medium.com/voxel51/imagenet-d-a-new-synthetic-test-set-designed-to-rigorously-evaluate-the-robustness-of-neural-ab8978716585).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Perfom zero-shot classification using CLIP in an attempt to verify/replicate the results in the paper\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform zero-shot classification using AIMv2\n",

    "5. Compare each models performance to the ground truth labels to see which performs better\n",

    "## What is AIMv2?\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMV2 is a family of **open vision encoders** pre-trained using a novel **multimodal autoregressive objective**. \n",
    "\n",
    "It autoregressively generates both **image patches and text tokens**, leveraging signals from all input tokens and patches for efficient training. AIMV2 uses a causal multimodal decoder that first regresses image patches and then decodes text tokens in an autoregressive manner. This model excels in tasks like **image recognition, grounding, and multimodal understanding**. AIMV2 consistently matches or outperforms existing self-supervised and vision-language pre-trained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMv2 deliberately processes **image patches first**, followed by text tokens:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visual Foundation**: Text predictions leverage *complete* visual context (like describing a photo only after seeing it in full).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unified Processing**: Predicts next image patches (e.g., reconstructing a photo’s bottom half from the top), then generates text autoregressively (e.g., completing \"A dog plays in...\" → \"park\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vision-Centric Design**: Forces robust visual representations to support both image reconstruction *and* text generation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I've written an in-depth blog about AIMv2, which you can read [here](https://medium.com/voxel51/visual-understanding-with-aimv2-76c58dcd68f9).\n",

    "I won't get into details about the CLIP family of models, but if you're interested in learning more [check out this blog](https://medium.com/voxel51/a-history-of-clip-model-training-data-advances-599473b48e1b). I do, however, want to briefly summarize the core differences between AIMv2 and CLIP:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **AIMv2** | **CLIP** |  \n",
    "|-----------|----------|  \n",
    "| Uses **autoregressive modeling** to reconstruct inputs *sequentially* (image patches → text tokens) | Uses **contrastive learning** to align *parallel* image-text pairs |  \n",
    "| Processes images and text as a **unified sequence** | Processes modalities **separately** |  \n",
    "| Extracts training signals from **every token** (dense supervision) | Relies on **positive/negative pair contrast** (sparse supervision) |  \n",
    "| Requires **no specialized batch processing** | Demands **large batches** for effective negative sampling |  \n",
