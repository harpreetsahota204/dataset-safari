    "[This subset of the SkyScenes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Voxel51/SkyScenes) dataset focuses on aerial perspectives captured at three different heights (15, 35, and 60 meters) while maintaining a consistent pitch angle of 0 degrees. All images are from the clear daytime conditions (ClearNoon) across four different urban environments: Town01, Town02, Town05, and Town07. For each scene configuration, the dataset includes RGB images along with their corresponding depth maps and segmentation masks.\n",
